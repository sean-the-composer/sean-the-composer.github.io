Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.</p>
<p>Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties or events beyond our control.</p>

 <li>pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("<strong>Pre-Paid Period</strong>").</li>
</ul>
<p>Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.</p>

<p>With the exception of Paid Subscriptions for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. Contact our Customer Support team <a href="https://support.spotify.com/contact-spotify-support/">here</a> for instructions on how to cancel. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version of the Spotify Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, except as expressly stated in these Terms.</p>

<p>These Terms will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify. Spotify may terminate these Terms (including any additional terms and conditions incorporated herein) or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time if we believe you have materially or repeatedly breached any of these Terms, if we stop providing the Spotify Service or any material component thereof on reasonable notice to you, or as we believe necessary to comply with applicable law. If Spotify terminates these Terms or suspends your access to the Spotify Service due to your material or repeated breach of these Terms or as we believe necessary to comply with applicable law, you agree that Spotify shall, subject to applicable laws, have no liability or responsibility to you for that termination or suspension, and (except as expressly provided in these Terms or as required by any applicable law) Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid.

<h4><a id="warranty-disclaimers" href="#warranty-disclaimers"></a><strong>Warranty disclaimers</strong></h4>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the exclusion and limitations in this section may not apply to you and nothing will affect your statutory rights (including under the Australian Consumer Law).</p>
<p><strong>Spotify will provide the Spotify Service using reasonable care and skill and in accordance with any specification of the Spotify Service set out in these Terms, however, subject to that, the Spotify Service is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. Further, Spotify and all owners of the content disclaim any express, implied, and statutory warranties regarding the content, including warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. While Spotify and any owner of content cannot guarantee that the Spotify Service or content is free of malware or other harmful components, Spotify uses reasonable efforts consistent with industry standards to prevent malware or harmful components in the Spotify Service. In addition, Spotify makes no representation regarding, nor does it warrant or assume any responsibility for, any third-party applications (or the content thereof), user content, devices or any product or service advertised, promoted or offered by a third party on or through the Spotify Service or any hyperlinked website, and Spotify is not responsible for any transactions between you and any third-party providers of the foregoing. No advice or information whether oral or in writing obtained by you from Spotify shall create any additional warranty on behalf of Spotify under these Terms. While using the Spotify Service, you may have access to explicit content filtering features, but use of these features may still result in some explicit content being served and you should not rely on such features to filter all explicit content. This section applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</strong></p>

<h4><a id="62-class-action-waiver" href="#62-class-action-waiver"></a><strong>6.2 CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></h4>
<p>WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<h4><a id="63-arbitration" href="#63-arbitration"></a><strong>6.3 ARBITRATION</strong></h4>
<p>If you are located in, are based in, have offices in, or do business in a jurisdiction in which this Section 6.3. is enforceable, the following mandatory arbitration provisions apply to you:</p>
<h4><a id="631-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration" href="#631-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration"></a><strong>6.3.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration</strong></h4>
<p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.</p>
<h4><a id="632-exceptions" href="#632-exceptions"></a><strong>6.3.2 Exceptions</strong></h4>
<p>Notwithstanding clause 6.3.1 above, you and Spotify both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a small claims court, (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (4) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
<h4><a id="633-arbitration-rules" href="#633-arbitration-rules"></a><strong>6.3.3 Arbitration rules</strong></h4>
<p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") then in force (the "ICC Rules") by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules, as modified by these Agreements, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.</p>
<p>Any arbitration will be conducted in the English language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the law of [the relevant state or country described in clause 6.1], without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.</p>
<h4><a id="634-time-for-filing" href="#634-time-for-filing"></a><strong>6.3.4 Time for filing</strong></h4>
<p>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within two (2) years after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a two-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>
<h4><a id="635-notice-process" href="#635-notice-process"></a><strong>6.3.5 Notice; Process</strong></h4>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Spotify's address for Notice is: [Spotify, Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA]. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Spotify shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (3) AUD$1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law. Except as required to enforce the arbitrator's decision and award, neither you nor Spotify shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.</p>
<h4><a id="636-modifications" href="#636-modifications"></a><strong>6.3.6 Modifications</strong></h4>
<p>In the event that Spotify makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Spotify's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Spotify's address for Notice, in which case your account with Spotify shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.</p>
<h4><a id="637-enforceability" href="#637-enforceability"></a><strong>6.3.7 Enforceability</strong></h4>
<p>If the class action waiver at Section 6.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this Section 6.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 6.3 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 6.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreements and you shall not be prevented from bringing proceedings at any time.</p>
<h2><a id="7-about-these-terms" href="#7-about-these-terms"></a><strong>7. About these Terms</strong></h2>
<p>Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p>
<h4><a id="changes" href="#changes"></a><strong>Changes</strong></h4>
<p>We may make changes to these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means (before they take effect), including by posting a revised Agreement on the applicable Spotify Service (provided that, for material changes, we will provide you with notice and seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other means). Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Terms, or other Spotify terms and conditions, incorporating such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes.</p>
<p>If you disagree with the changes, you can terminate your account before the changes take effect. Your use of the Spotify Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not wish to continue using the Spotify Service under the updated Terms, you may terminate your account by contacting us. The effective date set forth at the top of this document indicates when these Terms were last changed.</p>
<h4><a id="entire-agreement" href="#entire-agreement"></a><strong>Entire Agreement</strong></h4>
<p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, these Terms constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Terms, whether written or oral.</p>
<p>As noted above, other terms and conditions, guidelines and policies governing use of the Spotify Service are incorporated herein by reference. These include the following (a) additional terms and conditions related to specific services offered on the Spotify Service: the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/au/legal/paid-subscription-terms/">Spotify Paid Subscription Terms and Conditions</a>; <a href="https://www.spotify.com/au/legal/audiobook-purchase-terms/">Spotify Audiobook Purchase Terms and Conditions</a>; <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/gift-card/?_ga=2.21821883.1498063814.1616003614-503052261.1611071431#spotifys-terms--conditions-for-gift-cards-egift-cards-subscription-cards-premium-codes-pins-and-similar-items-the-card-terms">Spotify's Card Terms</a>; and the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/support-community-end-user-agreement/#spotify-support-community-terms">Spotify Support Community Terms;</a> and (b) guidelines and policies: the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/au/legal/privacy-policy/">Spotify Privacy Policy</a>; <a href="http://spotify.com/legal/user-guidelines">Spotify User Guidelines;</a> <a href="https://www.spotify.com/au/safetyandprivacy/platform-rules">Spotify Platform Rules</a> <a href="http://spotify.com/legal/user-guidelines">and</a> the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/copyright-policy/">Spotify Intellectual Property Policy</a>.</p>
<p>These additional terms and conditions and guidelines and policies may be changed by Spotify from time to time by posting the amended terms or policies on the Spotify Service. For any material changes to the additional terms and conditions, you will be provided with notice of such changes taking effect. For any changes to the guidelines or policies, the time frame for such policy terms to come into effect and the way in which we notify you of material amendments will depend on the nature of the change and the circumstances giving rise to the need to change the policy. Some policies may come into immediate effect, for example, as a result of content or consumer safety requirements or when a policy has been updated for clarity but without changing our guidelines. If you disagree with any changes, you can terminate your account pursuant to Section 6.</p>
<h4><a id="severability-and-waiver" href="#severability-and-waiver"></a><strong>Severability and Waiver</strong></h4>
<p>Unless as otherwise stated in these Terms, should any provision of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>Any failure by Spotify or any third-party beneficiary to enforce these Terms or any provision thereof shall not waive Spotify's or the applicable third-party beneficiary's right to do so.</p>
<h4><a id="assignment" href="#assignment"></a><strong>Assignment</strong></h4>
<p>Spotify may assign any or all of these Terms, and may assign or delegate, in whole or in part, any of its rights or obligations under these Terms. You may not assign these Terms, in whole or in part, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under these Terms, to any third party.</p></div></main><div><footer id="mh-footer" class="mh-footer-hover svelte-1kaaktl" aria-label="Footer"><nav class="svelte-1kaaktl"><div class="mh-tablet-container svelte-1kaaktl"><div class="mh-brand svelte-1kaaktl"><a href="https://www.spotify.com/au/" class="mh-footer-primary svelte-anf147"><span class="mh-footer-primary svelte-1gcdbl9"><svg id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 823.46 225.25"><g fill-rule="evenodd" class="svelte-1gcdbl9"><path d="m125.52,3.31C65.14.91,14.26,47.91,11.86,108.29c-2.4,60.38,44.61,111.26,104.98,113.66,60.38,2.4,111.26-44.6,113.66-104.98C232.89,56.59,185.89,5.7,125.52,3.31Zm46.18,160.28c-1.36,2.4-4.01,3.6-6.59,3.24-.79-.11-1.58-.37-2.32-.79-14.46-8.23-30.22-13.59-46.84-15.93-16.62-2.34-33.25-1.53-49.42,2.4-3.51.85-7.04-1.3-7.89-4.81-.85-3.51,1.3-7.04,4.81-7.89,17.78-4.32,36.06-5.21,54.32-2.64,18.26,2.57,35.58,8.46,51.49,17.51,3.13,1.79,4.23,5.77,2.45,8.91Zm14.38-28.72c-2.23,4.12-7.39,5.66-11.51,3.43-16.92-9.15-35.24-15.16-54.45-17.86-19.21-2.7-38.47-1.97-57.26,2.16-1.02.22-2.03.26-3.01.12-3.41-.48-6.33-3.02-7.11-6.59-1.01-4.58,1.89-9.11,6.47-10.12,20.77-4.57,42.06-5.38,63.28-2.4,21.21,2.98,41.46,9.62,60.16,19.74,4.13,2.23,5.66,7.38,3.43,11.51Zm15.94-32.38c-2.1,4.04-6.47,6.13-10.73,5.53-1.15-.16-2.28-.52-3.37-1.08-19.7-10.25-40.92-17.02-63.07-20.13-22.15-3.11-44.42-2.45-66.18,1.97-5.66,1.15-11.17-2.51-12.32-8.16-1.15-5.66,2.51-11.17,8.16-12.32,24.1-4.89,48.74-5.62,73.25-2.18,24.51,3.44,47.99,10.94,69.81,22.29,5.12,2.66,7.11,8.97,4.45,14.09Z"></path><path d="m318.54,169.81c-18.87,0-35.07-6.53-41.84-13.95-.64-.73-.73-1.13-.73-2.02v-22.09c0-1.05.89-1.45,1.61-.56,8.14,10.16,25.48,18.46,39.67,18.46,11.29,0,18.87-3.06,18.87-13.06,0-5.97-2.82-9.84-18.22-14.19l-8.87-2.5c-20.56-5.8-33.06-12.66-33.06-32.33,0-17.41,16.12-32.73,43.05-32.73,13.22,0,26.36,4.11,33.94,9.76.64.48.89.97.89,1.85v20.08c0,1.37-1.13,1.77-2.18.89-6.13-5.08-17.98-11.93-32.01-11.93s-20.64,6.29-20.64,12.09c0,6.13,4.27,7.82,19.51,12.34l7.58,2.26c23.46,7.01,33.06,16.85,33.06,33.14,0,20.96-17.41,34.51-40.63,34.51Zm164.39-42.09c0-12.82,8.87-22.33,21.37-22.33s21.28,9.51,21.28,22.33-8.87,22.33-21.28,22.33-21.37-9.51-21.37-22.33Zm21.28,42.09c26.04,0,44.18-18.62,44.18-42.09s-18.14-42.09-44.18-42.09-44.1,18.46-44.1,42.09,17.98,42.09,44.1,42.09Zm157.22-89.01v6.77h-13.71c-.73,0-1.13.4-1.13,1.13v16.12c0,.73.4,1.13,1.13,1.13h13.71v60.79c0,.73.4,1.13,1.13,1.13h20.64c.73,0,1.13-.4,1.13-1.13v-60.79h17.66l25.64,55.71-13.79,30.31c-.4.89.08,1.29.89,1.29h22.01c.73,0,1.05-.16,1.37-.89l45.55-103.52c.32-.73-.08-1.29-.89-1.29h-20.64c-.73,0-1.05.16-1.37.89l-20.8,49.99-20.88-49.99c-.32-.73-.64-.89-1.37-.89h-33.38v-5.32c0-8.71,5.89-12.74,13.46-12.74,4.51,0,9.43,2.34,12.9,4.43.81.48,1.37-.08,1.05-.81l-7.26-17.33c-.24-.56-.56-.89-1.13-1.21-3.55-1.85-9.35-3.47-15-3.47-17.09,0-26.93,13.06-26.93,29.67Zm-243,88.52c20.64,0,35.47-17.82,35.47-41.76s-15-41.44-35.64-41.44c-15.32,0-24.19,9.35-29.35,18.7v-16.12c0-.73-.4-1.13-1.13-1.13h-20.24c-.73,0-1.13.4-1.13,1.13v103.44c0,.73.4,1.13,1.13,1.13h20.24c.73,0,1.13-.4,1.13-1.13v-41.36c5.16,9.35,13.87,18.54,29.51,18.54Zm172.21-.32c6.77,0,13.3-1.77,17.17-4.03.56-.32.64-.64.64-1.21v-15.32c0-.81-.4-1.05-1.13-.64-2.34,1.29-5.4,2.34-9.59,2.34-6.61,0-10.8-3.87-10.8-12.42v-31.77h20.16c.73,0,1.13-.4,1.13-1.13v-16.12c0-.73-.4-1.13-1.13-1.13h-20.16v-21.04c0-.89-.56-1.37-1.37-.73l-36.04,28.38c-.48.4-.64.81-.64,1.45v9.19c0,.73.4,1.13,1.13,1.13h14.03v35.15c0,19.03,10.96,27.9,26.61,27.9Zm23.3-105.29c0,7.26,5.64,12.74,13.38,12.74s13.54-5.48,13.54-12.74-5.64-12.74-13.54-12.74-13.38,5.48-13.38,12.74Zm3.14,104.17h20.64c.73,0,1.13-.4,1.13-1.13v-78.04c0-.73-.4-1.13-1.13-1.13h-20.64c-.73,0-1.13.4-1.13,1.13v78.04c0,.73.4,1.13,1.13,1.13Zm-228.65-40.47c3.71-12.42,12.25-21.93,23.86-21.93s18.7,8.38,18.7,22.09-7.66,22.25-18.7,22.25-20.16-10.64-23.86-22.41Z"></path><path d="m810.1,92.31c-1.06-1.83-2.53-3.26-4.41-4.3-1.88-1.03-3.98-1.55-6.32-1.55s-4.44.52-6.32,1.55c-1.88,1.04-3.35,2.47-4.41,4.3-1.06,1.83-1.59,3.9-1.59,6.21s.53,4.34,1.59,6.17c1.06,1.83,2.53,3.26,4.41,4.3,1.88,1.04,3.98,1.55,6.32,1.55s4.44-.52,6.32-1.55,3.35-2.47,4.41-4.3c1.06-1.83,1.59-3.88,1.59-6.17s-.53-4.38-1.59-6.21Zm-1.93,11.36c-.86,1.52-2.06,2.7-3.59,3.56-1.53.85-3.27,1.28-5.2,1.28s-3.72-.43-5.25-1.28c-1.53-.85-2.72-2.04-3.57-3.56-.85-1.51-1.27-3.23-1.27-5.15s.42-3.63,1.27-5.13c.85-1.5,2.04-2.68,3.57-3.53,1.53-.85,3.28-1.28,5.25-1.28s3.67.43,5.2,1.28c1.53.85,2.73,2.04,3.59,3.56.86,1.52,1.29,3.23,1.29,5.15s-.43,3.59-1.29,5.11Z"></path><path d="m803.56,98.29c.82-.6,1.23-1.4,1.23-2.39s-.4-1.83-1.2-2.43c-.8-.6-1.96-.9-3.48-.9h-5.36v11.2h2.59v-4.45h1.41l3.41,4.45h3.18l-3.73-4.72c.79-.15,1.46-.4,1.96-.77Zm-3.86-.99h-2.36v-2.74h2.45c.73,0,1.29.11,1.68.34.39.23.59.58.59,1.06,0,.45-.21.79-.61,1.01-.41.23-.99.34-1.75.34Z"></path></g></svg>

We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Spotify shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Spotify in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (3) AUD$1,000.00, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law. Except as required to enforce the arbitrator's decision and award, neither you nor Spotify shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"#636-modifications\" id=\"636-modifications\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6.3.6 Modifications\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the event that Spotify makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Spotify's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Spotify's address for Notice, in which case your account with Spotify shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"#637-enforceability\" id=\"637-enforceability\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6.3.7 Enforceability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the class action waiver at Section 6.2 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of this Section 6.3 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 6.3 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 6.1 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Agreements and you shall not be prevented from bringing proceedings at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"#7-about-these-terms\" id=\"7-about-these-terms\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7.
